# QuantaHackers
This is QuantaHackers's project for the Qhack 2023 hackathon
**Project Name:** The Quantum Guinea Pig
**Team Name:** The QuantaHackers

**Challenges:** Visualization Challenge, Amazon Bracket Challenge, Quantum Chemistry Challenge, Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing Challenge, Quantum computing today!, QEC and Compilation Challenge, NVIDIA Challenge
 

Power-Up plan:
**AWS Power Up:** We will use this powerup to simulate our code on the AWS Quantum Computer, so we can make our code compatible and more efficient. We will also use this power up to test our code efficiently, and debug if necessary.
**IBM Quantum/PINQ^2 Power Up:** We will use this power up to run our code on the IBM Quantum computer in order to make our code compatible and more efficient. We can use this to test our code’s efficiency and if needed to debug some problems.
**NVIDIA/Cyxtera/Run:AI GPU Power Up:** We will use this power up to run our code and simulate it on the GPU so we can see the compatibility of our project on many different machines, and we can fix and debug our code easily.
**NVIDIA/Cyxtera/Run:AI QODA Power-Up:** We will use this power up to run our code on the quantum computer, allowing us to test the code's efficiency and compatibility and if needed debug.

 Access to power ups:

We allow Xanadu Quantum Technologies to share our email addresses with the Power-Up Sponsors for the purpose of facilitating the delivery of the Power-Ups.
